TODO: This directory should be filed by three example programs using the
forchess API: (1) a text based one which simply prints moves made by the AI and
takes moves as input from the user, (2) a GUI version which allows saving and
loading games written with a C++ wrapper around the C library, and (3) an
IRCbot which allows multiple people to play.
