LibForchess v0.8.2 (2011/11/25)


SUMMARY
    LibForchess is an API wrapper around an AI for playing a 4-player variant
    of chess called "Forchess".  More information about the game itself can be
    found at its official website http://www.intuitor.com/forchess/


REQUIREMENTS
    LibForchess requires no external dependencies and should build in any
    *nix-style environment with the typical GNU build tools.  For example, on
    Ubuntu these can be installed with:
        sudo aptitude install build-essential

    In order to run the test suite, Check (the C unit testing framework) needs
    to be installed.  For example, on Ubuntu this can be installed with:
        sudo aptitude install check

    In order to build the documentation files, Doxygen needs to be installed.
    For example, on Ubuntu this can be installed with:
        sudo aptitude install doxygen


INSTALLATION
    To build the LibForchess AI library run "make libforchess".  This will
    create the archive file "lib/libforchess.a".  To test the library run
    "export OSTYPE" followed by "make check".


USAGE
    Documentation in manpage format can be made available by running
    "make docs".  The relevant documentation will be built and placed in
    docs/man.  An example program can be found in examples/cli/simple.c which
    should give a developer an idea of how to build their own Forchess playing
    program with this API.  In order to build the example program run
    "make examples".  The resulting program is built as a.out in the top
    directory.  See "./a.out --help" for instructions.
