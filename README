LibForchess v0.8.4 (2011/12/29)


SUMMARY
    LibForchess is an API wrapper around an AI for playing a 4-player variant
    of chess called "Forchess".  More information about the game itself can be
    found at its official website http://www.intuitor.com/forchess/


REQUIREMENTS
    LibForchess requires no external dependencies and should build in any
    *nix-style environment with the typical GNU build tools.  For example, on
    Ubuntu these can be installed with:
        sudo aptitude install build-essential

    In order to run the test suite, Check (the C unit testing framework) needs
    to be installed.  For example, on Ubuntu this can be installed with:
        sudo aptitude install check


INSTALLATION
    To build the LibForchess AI library run "make libforchess".  This will
    create the shared object file "lib/libforchess.so".  To test the library
    run "make check".


USAGE
    An example program can be found in examples/cli/simple.c which should give
    a developer an idea of how to build their own Forchess playing program with
    this API.  In order to build the example program run "make examples".  The
    resulting program is built as a.out in the top directory.  See
    "./a.out --help" for instructions.

TROUBLE-SHOOTING
    If while trying to run the test suite or example program, you get the error:
    "error while loading shared libraries: libforchess.so: cannot open shared
    object file: No such file or directory", then you may need to update your
    LD path.  Try running "sudo ldconfig $(pwd)/lib" from the top level repo
    directory and try again.

    If you try to compile the test suite, and you get errors about it not being
    able to find "check", then make sure that check.h is in your include path
    and libcheck is in the library path.
